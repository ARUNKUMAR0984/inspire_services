    <h1>From Homeless to Harvard</h1>
    <p>
      Liz Murray's journey from living on the streets of New York to attending Harvard University is a testament to human resilience. 
      Born to drug-addicted parents, Liz faced unimaginable hardships, including homelessness by the age of 15. 
      Despite these challenges, she remained committed to her education.
    </p>
    <p>
      She completed high school in just two years while living on the streets and was later awarded a scholarship from The New York Times, 
      which enabled her to attend Harvard. Her story inspired a movie titled "Homeless to Harvard," and she continues to motivate people 
      around the world through her work as a speaker and author.
